Bystander effect
傍観者効果

If you suffer a heart attack in a crowd, you would be less likely to get help than if there were only one or two people around you.

SCIENTIFIC AMERICANから引用

the more people there are around the less likely bystanders are to intervene in an emergency situation
人がその場に多ければ多いほど、助けようとする人が減る

the diffusion of responsibility among many people
責任が拡散される
believe someone else will step forward and take action
他の誰かがやるだろうという気持ち
assuming other people such as doctors and police officers are more qualified to help
behave appropriately
もっと適した人がいるのではないか
（fearing harm and ）worrying their intervention will be unneeded or unwanted
実はいらないんじゃないか

などのネガティヴな評価を恐れる
x   people in the situation which there are a few people are more likely to notice a victim than groups 


alone people are more likely to notice a victim than bystanders and group 
this is cause when people are together we tend to focus on each other and pay less attention to our surroundings 

また、人と一緒にいるときはお互いを意識し、周りへの意識が減る

once they notice the victim they look at other people nearby to understand the situation
if no one  else is reacting,  they feel like they get relieved

almost the same things happen to a meeting in a workplace.
